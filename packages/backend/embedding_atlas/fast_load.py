"""DuckDB-native fast-path loader for GIS parquet files.

For single-parquet inputs with either a lon/lat pair or a WKB geometry
column, this loader materialises the file into a DuckDB TABLE via a
single ``CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT`` that pulls the rows in once and
projects the parquet reader's ``file_row_number`` virtual column under
``__row_index__`` — so the viewer never has to do its own
``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`` + ``UPDATE`` rowid pass.

Why a TABLE and not a VIEW: the viewer's ``makeCategoryColumn`` (color
by) issues ``ALTER TABLE dataset ADD COLUMN ...`` + ``UPDATE`` on every
color-by click. DuckDB only allows ``ALTER VIEW`` on views, so a
view-backed dataset hard-fails the moment the user picks a color
column. A 322 M-row materialisation takes ~75 s on a 16-core box and
each subsequent ALTER+UPDATE is ~9 s — slower than a view at startup,
but functional through the full feature surface.

The previous CTAS path crashed on >~10 GB parquet because DuckDB's
defaults are ``memory_limit = 80% RAM`` (no headroom) and
``temp_directory = '.tmp'`` (a relative path that often can't be
created from the user's cwd). When the working set spilled past the
limit it had nowhere to go and the process OOM-killed mid-load. We now
set ``memory_limit`` to a generous-but-bounded fraction of system RAM
and pin ``temp_directory`` to the OS tmp dir so spilling always has a
home.

Used by:
  * ``apps/desktop`` sidecar — always.
  * ``packages/backend`` CLI (``geospatial-atlas``) — auto-selected when
    inputs are a single Parquet with no ``--query``/``--sample`` and
    no embedding generation is requested.
  * Frontend-only / static distros — unaffected; they use DuckDB-WASM
    directly in the browser.

# DuckDB temp-directory cleanup
# -----------------------------

# 322 M-row scale a single load can spill 100+ GB; without explicit

# rare — typically only on reboot, sometimes after several days). One
# session at a time is fine; four crashed sessions later the user is
# down 400 GB of disk for no benefit.
