# Geospatial Atlas

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1125307298.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19745397)

This is a fork of [Embedding Atlas](https://apple.github.io/embedding-atlas) adapted for geospatial data. As embeddings or rather their 2D projections share the exact same visualization challenges like 2D geospatial data, Embedding Atlas and all its functionality serve a great deal in geospatial data exploration!

**Verified at 322 M points** in the desktop app on a 32 GB Apple Silicon laptop, **~100 M** in a vanilla browser tab (Chrome / Safari / Firefox-with-flag). For the full optimization journey see [docs/optimization_history.md](docs/optimization_history.md) and [docs/PERF-75M.md](docs/PERF-75M.md). Browser-side scale ceilings and the V8-flag workaround for the 322 M case are documented in [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daa1d31b-5b46-4c24-96d6-bad56e609d0c" />

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/do-me/geospatial-atlas.git
cd geospatial-atlas
npm install
npm run build
```

Running on an Intel Mac? Then add this line to `packages/backend/pyproject.toml`:

`required-environments = ["sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'x86_64'"]`

For Windows, Silicon Macs and Linux everything should work out of the box.

## Usage (after installation above)

Execute this command directly from the root directory of the repository. The parquet file must either contain a geometry column or lat lon / latitude longitude columns.

```bash
uv --directory packages/backend run geospatial-atlas your_dataset_with_lat_lon_coords.parquet
```

If you have a small dataset (<5M places) you can add the `--text` flag to include a text column. Your names are then indexed and searchable. For large files this might cause out-of-memory errors.

```bash
uv --directory packages/backend run geospatial-atlas your_dataset_with_lat_lon_coords.parquet --text your_name_column
```

Alternatively you can cd into the backend folder and run it from there:

```
cd packages/backend
uv run geospatial-atlas your_dataset_with_lat_lon_coords.parquet --text your_name_column
```

The screenshots above were created with these two datasets:

- [Overture Maps Places](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/places/), download with `uvx overturemaps download -f geoparquet --type=place -o places.parquet`
- [Foursquare 100M Places](https://huggingface.co/datasets/do-me/foursquare_places_100M), [direct download]()
- [50k poorly geocoded news](https://huggingface.co/datasets/do-me/50k_poorly_geocoded_news), [direct download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/do-me/50k_poorly_geocoded_news/resolve/main/geocoded_news.parquet)

## Desktop app releases

Pre-built native apps (Electron shell + bundled Python sidecar) are on
the [releases page](https://github.com/do-me/geospatial-atlas/releases).

| Platform                     | File                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon)        | `geospatial-atlas-macos-arm64.dmg`       |
| Linux x86_64 (Debian/Ubuntu) | `geospatial-atlas-linux-x64.deb`         |
| Linux x86_64 (Fedora/RHEL)   | `geospatial-atlas-linux-x64.rpm`         |
| Windows x86_64 (MSI)         | `geospatial-atlas-windows-x64.msi`       |
| Windows x86_64 (NSIS setup)  | `geospatial-atlas-windows-x64-setup.exe` |

Bundles are **unsigned** — Gatekeeper (macOS) and SmartScreen (Windows)
will warn on first launch. Intel-Mac users aren't served by a
pre-built bundle due to lack of runners on GitHub (11h waiting time and more); fall back to the CLI path further down.

### macOS: "app is damaged and can't be opened"

That's a misleading Gatekeeper message for unsigned apps downloaded
from the internet. After dragging **Geospatial Atlas** into
**Applications**, strip the quarantine attribute once:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/Geospatial Atlas.app"
```

Then double-click as usual. (Alternative: **System Settings → Privacy
& Security → Open Anyway** after a failed launch attempt.)

### Linux / Windows

```bash
sudo dpkg -i geospatial-atlas-linux-x64.deb   # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo rpm  -i geospatial-atlas-linux-x64.rpm   # Fedora / RHEL
```

On Windows, SmartScreen says "unrecognized publisher" — click **More
info → Run anyway**.

## Connect an LLM agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor, …)

The app (CLI and desktop, starting with v0.0.2) ships a **Model Context
Protocol** server at `/mcp`. LLM clients can drive the viewer live:
run SQL, add charts, fly to coordinates, grab screenshots of regions,
cross-filter by bounding box, and more. Full setup: [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md).

Tool surface at a glance (31 tools):

- **Data** — `get_data_schema`, `run_sql_query`
- **Charts** — `list_charts`, `add_chart`, `delete_chart`,
  `get_chart_spec`/`set_chart_spec`,
  `get_chart_state`/`set_chart_state`/`clear_chart_state`,
  `get_chart_screenshot`
- **Layout** — `get_layout_type`/`set_layout_type`,
  `get_layout_state`/`set_layout_state`, `get_full_screenshot`
- **Rendering** — `list_renderers`, `get_column_styles`, `set_column_style`
- **Geospatial** (v0.0.2) — `get_map_viewport`, `fly_to_point`,
  `fly_to_bbox`, `get_map_screenshot`, `get_map_screenshot_at`,
  `select_bbox`, `clear_selection`, `count_in_bbox`, `find_nearby`,
  `density_grid`, `highlight_points`, `set_basemap_style`

Quick start with the CLI:

```bash
uv --directory packages/backend run geospatial-atlas your.parquet --mcp
# → URL: http://localhost:5055
# → MCP server: http://localhost:5055/mcp
```

Open the viewer at that URL in a real browser tab (for WebGPU), then
point your LLM client's MCP config at `http://localhost:5055/mcp`. For
autonomous / CI use, a Playwright-based headless viewer harness lives
in `scripts/mcp_harness/`.

The desktop app surfaces a copyable MCP URL directly in the UI after
a dataset is loaded (enabled by default, toggleable on the picker).

### Client config

Most clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, …) take a
JSON entry with a single `url` field:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "geospatial-atlas": {
      "url": "http://localhost:5055/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Desktop config file locations:

| OS      | Path                                                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`                     |
| Linux   | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`                     |

Fully quit and reopen the client — the 31 tools above should appear in
the tool picker. Swap the port if the server picked a different one
(the URL banner prints the actual port on launch).

## Build & Deploy GitHub Pages

The static web app is deployed manually (no CI). To rebuild and deploy:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# 2. Build all packages (utils, component, table, viewer, docs)
npm run build

# 3. Deploy the built site to the gh-pages branch
./scripts/deploy-gh-pages.sh
```

Then in GitHub → Settings → Pages, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (root `/`).

The live site is available at: https://do-me.github.io/geospatial-atlas/

## Testing

End-to-end tests use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and cover both runtime modes (server mode with Python backend, and frontend-only mode with Vite dev server + DuckDB WASM).

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
npm run build              # server-mode tests need the built viewer
npx playwright install chromium
```

On first run the test suite auto-downloads a ~29 MB parquet fixture ([GISCO Education](https://github.com/do-me/geospatial-atlas-apps/tree/main/GISCO_Education)) and caches it in `e2e/.data/` (git-ignored). Override with `E2E_PARQUET_FILE=/path/to/file.parquet` if needed.

**Run all tests:**

```bash
npx playwright test
```

**Run a single mode:**

```bash
npx playwright test --project server-mode
npx playwright test --project frontend-mode
```

**View the HTML report** (generated on every run):

```bash
npx playwright show-report e2e/playwright-report
```

Test artifacts (traces, screenshots on failure, HTML report) are written to `e2e/test-results/` and `e2e/playwright-report/` — both git-ignored.

## Performance

Headline numbers per distribution:

| Distro                       |              Verified ceiling | Notes                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop (Electron)           |                  322 M points | M-series, 32 GB unified memory. V8 budget tuned to 16 GB; full feature surface.       |
| Backend-frontend / browser   | ~100 M points (without flags) | 322 M reachable in Chrome with `--js-flags="--max-old-space-size=16384 --expose-gc"`. |
| Standalone web (DuckDB-WASM) |      ~75 M points (estimated) | DuckDB-WASM 2 GB internal cap dominates; not measured at higher scale.                |

Filter and tooltip latency at 322 M: ~3 s perceived between filter click
and painted pixel; ~50 ms tooltip pick. Cold load (parquet → first
frame) at 322 M: ~12–15 s.

The two deep-dives are kept under [`docs/`](docs/):

- [`docs/optimization_history.md`](docs/optimization_history.md) — the
  322 M scaling chapter. Memory pipeline, Mosaic LRU pinning, Metal
  watchdog, multi-distro compatibility matrix, current bottleneck,
  open follow-ups.
- [`docs/PERF-75M.md`](docs/PERF-75M.md) — the prior 75 M chapter.
  Compaction + indirect draw, gesture-only downsample, workgroup-size
  sweep.

## Troubleshooting

### `Array buffer allocation failed` / blank canvas at >100 M points

The renderer's V8 heap budget is exhausted. The desktop app is auto-
tuned to 16 GB; a vanilla browser tab is ~4 GB.

- Easiest path: use the [desktop app](#desktop-app-download-v007).
- Browser fallback: launch Chrome with elevated V8 flags.
  ```bash
  # macOS
  /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \
    --js-flags="--max-old-space-size=16384 --expose-gc" \
    http://localhost:5055
  # Linux
  google-chrome --js-flags="--max-old-space-size=16384 --expose-gc" \
    http://localhost:5055
  ```
- Or reduce the working set (SQL filter, `--sample`, smaller column set).

### Canvas freezes mid-pan on macOS, recovers only on reload

Metal's 5 s `MTLCommandBuffer` watchdog killed a draw pass. We chunk
dispatches to stay under the limit, but tabs stalled by DevTools or
extreme background load can re-trip it. Reload the page; the underlying
data and view state are preserved in the URL.

### Empty map after switching datasets in the desktop app

`viewer-state.json` retains per-dataset precomputed-column metadata; if
the same parquet is reloaded with a different schema the stale entry
wins. Quit the app, then on macOS:

```bash
rm "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Geospatial Atlas/viewer-state.json"
```

(Equivalent path under `%APPDATA%` on Windows, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` on
Linux.) Relaunch.

### Disk fills up after running the CLI on a huge parquet

DuckDB spills to `$TMPDIR/duckdb_gsa_*`. Sessions on builds that
predate the auto-cleanup landing may have left 80–120 GB dirs behind.
Sweep manually:

```bash
rm -rf "$TMPDIR"/duckdb_gsa_*
```

Recent builds clean their own temp dir on shutdown and sweep stale
orphans (>24 h) on startup; no manual action needed.

## Roadmap & known limitations

The list below distinguishes deferred work that has been **measured**
(numbers from the optimization doc) from generic feature requests.
PRs welcome on any of them; cross-link to the relevant section of
`docs/optimization_history.md` in the PR description.

### Renderer / front-end

- Move Arrow `Vector.toArray()` off the main thread. At 322 M with the
  category column it's ~1.8 s blocking — currently the longest
  blocking JS phase per filter click.
- Stream-decode the wire directly into pre-allocated typed arrays.
  Skips the intermediate Arrow Table and lowers peak heap below 4 GB
  so vanilla Chrome works at 322 M without `--js-flags`.
- `EmbeddingViewImpl.svelte:368` should declare `let renderer = $state.raw(null)`
  rather than `$state(null)`. The reactive Source proxy adds a duplicate
  retainer chain visible in heap snapshots; ~50 MB overhead at long-
  session steady state.
- `device.lost` recovery UX. A Metal watchdog trip currently leaves the
  canvas blank with no affordance. Surface a "GPU recovered — click to
  re-render" banner.
- GPU buffer pool: every filter click destroys ~3 GB of GPU buffers and
  reallocates ~3 GB. A 2-slot ring per logical buffer would let the
  new allocation reuse the old storage.

### Loader / sidecar

- Cold-init profile at 322 M (~12–15 s end-to-end). The split between
  parquet footer scan and prewarm is unmeasured.
- Clamp Electron's 16 GB V8 budget to `min(16 GB, totalmem * 0.5)` so
  16 GB-RAM machines don't risk OS-level OOM-killer events.

### Distros

- DuckDB-WASM end-to-end at 200–300 M parquet (standalone web). Untested.
- Selection (lasso / box) at 322 M. Untested; may stress the same
  `toArray()` path.
- Intel Mac desktop bundle. Currently no GitHub runner; users fall
  back to the CLI path.

### UX (from the prior backlog)

- Disallow zoom-out below z = 0 (current shifting artefact).
- Adapt density and point-radius ranges across zoom levels.
- Basemap attribution.
- Standalone `geospatial-atlas` PyPI package.
